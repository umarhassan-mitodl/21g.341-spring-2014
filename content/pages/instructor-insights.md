## Instructor Interview

{{< quote "I encourage my students to read French newspapers, listen to French radio, or watch French TV in order to gain context." "—Catherine Clark" >}}

_Below, Catherine Clark describes various aspects of how she taught_ 21G.341 Contemporary French Film and Social Issues.

This content of this course is dynamic because it features actual contemporary social issues in France and the films that have become part of discussions around them.

I have found it helpful to pair the films with readings that give students understandings of these social contexts. I also encourage my students to read French newspapers, listen to French radio, or watch French TV. Short lectures in class help show them how something they find shocking or innocuous might read to a French audience.

Students lead many of the discussions in this class. My advice for other educators hoping to do something similar would be to pair student-led discussions with questions generated by the instructor. This allows the instructor to help guide students’ approach to the week’s materials.
